# Cloud Academy To-Do-App: TypeScript Edition!

I learning TypeScript, so I will convert a simple To Do App from previous tutorials into one built with TypeScript.

Converting this hasn't been really effective as I've just added types, and use the *any* type often and thereby not fully leveraging the advantages of TypeScript. Also, I was not able to get it to recognise main.js, only the index.js compiled from index.ts.

Original repo for the To Do App[here](https://github.com/iamjonjackson/html5-js-tutorials)

Done as part of my time on the QA Academy Bench.
